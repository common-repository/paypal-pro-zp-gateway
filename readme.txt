This plugin is a gateway between your ZetaPrints portal and PayPal Pro. Use it to accept credit cards directly on your website.

== Description ==
This plugin sits between your [ZetaPrints portal](http://www.zetaprints.com) and PayPal Pro. 
Users place orders on ZetaPrints and redirected to a certain page on your WordPress site to make a payment. 

The page contains a form generated by the plugin. Users enter their credit card details and the transaction is processed via PayPal Pro API. The user gets a confirmation screen with success or failure message.
At the same time, the plugin sends a message to ZetaPrints to confirm the payment. ZetaPrints updates order status and balance accordingly.
In the end, the user returns to the list of orders on ZetaPrints.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where does it store transaction details? =

The plugin does not store any details. It only passes the details between the user, PayPalPro and ZetaPrints. There is no data left about the transaction once the user leaves the payments page.

= Who can see the credit card details? =

Credit card details are sent to PayPal Pro only.

= Why is PayPal Pro better the usual PayPal payments page? =
It's not better. It is more flexible. PayPal may be a bit picky with some credit cards and decline transactions you would risk to accept yourself. In this case you'd better use this plugin and PayPal Pro.

= Does it work with ZetaPrints only? =
Yes. Some interfaces are specific to ZetaPrints. You are welcome to modify the code and adapt it to your own system or shopping cart.
